  # Configure vCPU and indirectly memory resources for the application. 
  # The memory assigned to the application is directly proportional to the 
  # requested vCPU number multiplied by 4. For example, if cpu is set to 1, 4Gi
  # memory is allocated to the application; if cpu is set to 2, 8Gi of memory
  # is allocated to the application; and so on.

    # The vCPU number for the application. If not set, it defaults to 1 vCPU. 
    # The max number of vCPU that can be requested is 14.
